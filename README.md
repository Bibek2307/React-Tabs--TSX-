A **React + TypeScript frontend project** that simulates a YouTube channel profile page.  
It features **tab navigation** for sections like Home, About, Projects, Courses, and Contact, along with image upload options for the **channel banner** and **profile icon**.  
This app is designed purely for **visualization purposes** to see how a YouTube channel might look before actually creating one.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-tabs-yt-template.git
   cd react-tabs-yt-template
   ```
